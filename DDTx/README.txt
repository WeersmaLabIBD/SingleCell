This project features a case series of 3 small bowel transplant patients.
The aims of this project are to find out:
1. How immune cell repopulation (recipient cells--> donor organ) happens (over time)
2. Which cell composition (shifts) are related to rejection (grade)? And with which transcriptional changes
3. Which transcriptional/compositional changes happen before and after a rejection phase

We sampled small bowel graft biopsies over time, processed the biopsies for single cell sequencing according to the cryopreserved one-step collagenase protocol (Uniken Venema, Ramirez-Sanchez et al, Sci rep 2022), and made use of Souporcell (Heaton, Nature Methods 2020) to separate donor and recipient cells
